# Introduction
This project focuses on exploratory analysis of Data Science job postings in 2023. It explores high paying jobs and top paying skills while identifying the optimal skills to learn for high paying jobs.

# Background
I was curious to develop SQL skills as I wanted to make a career transition to the Data Science industry. So that's when I found [Luke Barousse](https://datanerd.tech)'s app to access data for my analysis. 

I would like to shoutout to him and [Kelly Adams](https://www.kellyjadams.com) for their course on [SQL for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) to inspire me for this project.

Insights related to following crucial questions were derived from the SQL queries:

1. What are the top-paying jobs in Canada?
2. What skills are required for these top paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. What skills are required in top-paying jobs?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used

To develop my sql skills and build the project, I used following list of tools:
- **SQL** : - Fundamental in analyzing job postings data to identify key insights.
- **PostgreSQL** : - Database chosen to handle large dataset of the job postings data.
- **SQLite Viz** : - Learnt basic SQL concepts and solved practice problems on this database to gain SQL programming skills.
- **VS Code** : - Used the code editor to manage database and execute SQL queries.
- **Git & Github** : - Essential for version control and showcasing my project to the online community.
